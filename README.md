The aim of this repo is to implement HTMX serverside rendering with tailwind css.

Let this be a CRUD app. The user should be able to:
- add a person with his birthday
- edit a record
- delete a record

Additionally create a dockerfile.

Non-functional requirement - unused css must be pruned.

For simplicity store records in a CSV file.
